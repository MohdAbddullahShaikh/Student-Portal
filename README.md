#Literature review meaning 
 
<b>Abstract:</b> The development of personalized Student Management Systems 
(SMS) represents a significant leap forward in educational technology. This 
literature review explores the current landscape of SMS, focusing on the 
technological advancements, user-centric features, and the potential for 
customization to meet specific institutional needs. 
 
Introduction: Student Management Systems have traditionally been 
designed to address the generic needs of educational institutions. However, 
with the advent of customizable systems, there is a shift towards creating 
solutions that cater to the unique requirements of each institution. This 
review examines how such systems, including the one developed for this 
project, enhance user experience and operational efficiency. 
 
Technological Framework: The project leverages a robust technological 
framework comprising Java, J2EE, JSP, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and 
integrates Hibernate and Maven for backend operations. The deployment on 
an Apache Tomcat server ensures reliable and scalable performance. 
 
 
#Customization and User Experience: 
 
Easily Updateable Home Webpage: The system allows for quick updates 
to the homepage, ensuring that the most relevant information is always front 
and center. 
 
Dynamic Notice and Announcement Updates: Administrators can post 
notices and announcements in real-time, which are immediately accessible 
to the student body. 
 
Efficient Result Management: The system simplifies the process of 
uploading and downloading results, making it a seamless experience for 
both faculty and students. 
 
Team Lead Creation: It supports the formation of team leads within the 
system, promoting a structured approach to group projects and collaborative 
learning.

# **Implementation** 
 
TOOLS REQUIRED 
 
#Java: 
Java is a high level class base object oriented programing language it is a 
hybrid language it’s have compiler interpreter both. Java is platform 
Independent programing language. Java was developed by Sun 
Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. 
James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was 
Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and 
his team changed the name from Oak to Java. 
 
There are four major pillars of java. 
 
1. Abstraction 
2. Encapsulation 
3. Inheritance 
4. Polymorphism 

 
 
#Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE): 
The Java EE stands for Java Enterprise Edition, which was earlier known 
as J2EE and is currently known as Jakarta EE. It is a set of specifications 
wrapping around Java SE (Standard Edition). The Java EE provides a 
platform for developers with enterprise features such as distributed 
computing and web services. Java EE applications are usually run on 
reference run times such as microservers or application servers. Examples 
of some contexts where Java EE is used are e-commerce, accounting, 
banking information systems. 
  
 
   
 
#Hibernate: 
Hibernate is a Java framework that simplifies the development of Java 
application to interact with the database. It is an open source, lightweight, 
ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool. Hibernate implements the 
specifications of JPA (Java Persistence API) for data persistence. 
 
#ORM Tool 
An ORM tool simplifies the data creation, data manipulation and data 
access. It is a programming technique that maps the object to the data 
stored in the database. 

 
 
#MySQL: 
A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all 
the data in one big storeroom. The database structures are organized into 
physical files optimized for speed. The logical model, with objects such 
as databases, tables, views, rows, and columns, offers a flexible 
programming environment. You set up rules governing the relationships 
between different data fields, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, unique, 
required or optional, and “pointers” between different tables. The 
database enforces these rules, so that with a well-designed database, your 
application never sees inconsistent, duplicate, orphan, out-of-date, or 
missing data. 

 
 
#Java Server Pages (JSP): 
In Java, JSP stands for Java Server Pages. It is a server-side technology 
which is used for creating web applications. It is used to create dynamic 
web content. JSP consists of both HTML tags and JSP tags. In this, JSP 
tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages. It is an advanced 
version of Servlet Technology i.e. a web-based technology that helps us 
to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java code 
can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into 
a servlet by the JSP container before processing the client’s request. JSP 
has various features like JSP Expressions, JSP tags, JSP Expression 
Language, etc. 
A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags. The JSP pages are 
easier to maintain than Servlet because we can separate designing and 
development. It provides some additional features such as Expression 
Language, Custom Tags, etc. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
#Bootstrap 5: 
* Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web 
development. 
* Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for 
typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image 
carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins 
* Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive 
designs. 
 
Advantages of Bootstrap: 
* Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS 
can start using Bootstrap 
* Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, 
tablets, and desktops 
* Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of 
the core framework 
*Browser compatibility: Bootstrap 5 is compatible with all modern 
browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera).
